RESTAURANT REVIEW APP

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, STUDENT will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, a static design was converted to responsive design with accessibility addressed. A service worker was also integrated. In **Stage Two**, the app was changed to offline first through the integration of the IndexedDb API. Performance enhancements were done through Gulp. In **Stage Three**, the app added capability to cache reviews when user is offline or has connectivity issues, which can be sent out once the user reconnects.

**TO START**
