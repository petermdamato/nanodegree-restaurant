PART I - RESTAURANT REVIEW APP

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, STUDENT will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

TODO (OPTIONAL): Add functionality to the service worker
